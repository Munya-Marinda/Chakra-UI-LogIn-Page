# This is a Log-In interface that I built using React.js and Chakra-UI.

- This is a simple responsive log-in page.
- I did this project as a challenge in order to learn Chakra-Ui. 
- Chakra-UI is a modular and component libraries for building use interfaces.
- It took close to a week to learn how it's implemented and the learning process felt natural as it is built to work with React JS.
- The biggest challenge was figuring how to make the interface responsive
- The project was built from scratch with only boilerplate code created by Next JS
- I designed all the image assets which includes the logo, background and illustration.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started Today

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
